# College-Event-Management-System
<h1>Third Year IT -DBMS Mini Project</h1>


<h4>1. ABSTRACT</h4>


In this mini project we have developed the website for managing events in college . 
For this we have used MYSQL as database ,HTML and CSS as frontend and 
Java(JSP,JDBC) for backend programming .Using this website organization 
can check who are participating in event and manage them accordingly. In this we
have made a principle login for deleting any organization if its not active.



<h4>2. INTRODUCTION</h4>


This report discusses the result of the work done in the development of "College Event 
Management System ” on “JSP” front-end platform and “MySQL” back-end Platform. In the 
development of an application, JSP provides a good connecting facility between all pages, also 
the MySQL back-end is important as it saves all the data related to the application.



<h4>3. OBJECTIVE</h4>


1)To help the organizers by keeping record of each student who are participating.

2)To help the participant by keeping there record of participation if they are participating in multiple events.

3)Also user can check in which event he or she has participated.

4)Principle of college can manage the organization.



<h4>4. METHODOLOGY</h4>


To implement the above goals, the following methodology needs to be followed:

1. Specifying the application and various components of the architecture.

2. Specifying the bindings between the tasks and the resources either manually 
 or using design tools.
 
3. Specifying the port interconnections between the resources.

<h4>7. Functionality Of Each Module</h4> 

<h5>User(Participant) Functionalities :</h5>


 In this project we are planning to make login page for students(users).

 In this he or she will can put all his or her information by signing in then according to that we will create the 
user table ( in database) . 

 We will provide facility to update the details of students ( participants ) .

 Also we will provide event registration facility for students ( participants ) .

 Also participant can view for how many events he has registered for.



<h5>Admin(Organization) Functionalities :</h5>

<h4>8. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION</h4>


We wanted to keep the entire record of participants who are participating in any event. To make
events organized so that less crowded space will be there. To help organizers who are 
organizing the event by keeping record of every single participant. We can participate in any 
ongoing event by just one click at any time.

The fact that this project could be made use of in the practical scenario of other various events 
happening in out college was the motivation behind us choosing this problem statement. It would 
serve the dual purpose of us gaining more knowledge about DBMS as well as the creation of 
something useful for our college.



<h4>9. SCOPE</h4>


The scope of the project is really wide as it can be used by various other colleges for handling 
any event organized by an organizations . The code is simple and readable and written in a 
systematic manner making it easier for developers to reuse the code.
